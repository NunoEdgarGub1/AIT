The lexDAO Token Accreditation Program (TAP) streamlines the issuance of attorney certification for investor accreditation with questionnaires and record-keeping integrated with [non-fungible tokens (ERC-721)](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721).

# Legal Base

The "Accredited investor" verification rules of Reg. D (506(c)) allow an attorney or other trusted third-party advisor to certify such status to allow issuers to comply with their obligation to take reasonable steps to verify the status of purchasers of their securities. 

# Code Base

lexDAO on [Aragpn](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/lexdao/home/) controls attorney registrations for this certification role.  Authorized lexDAO attorneys can use this [OpenLaw form] (https://lib.openlaw.io/web/default/template/accredited%20investor%20token%20certification) to cerfify your accreditation status and allow you to legibly participate in regulated token sales that might otherwise be deemed securities under U.S. federal law.
